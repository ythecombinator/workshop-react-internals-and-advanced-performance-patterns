# React: Internals & Advanced Performance Patterns Workshop

Welcome to the `React: Internals & Advanced Performance Patterns` workshop!

This workshop is designed to help you understand the inner workings of React and
master advanced performance optimization techniques.

## 📋 Overview

This workshop explores React's internal architecture and mechanisms through
interactive examples and exercises. You'll gain insights into:

- Scheduling, parallelism and concurrency in React and on the web
- Compilers, the React Compiler, Million Lint and related static analysis case
  studies
- Measurement with timing, profiling and sensor APIs + crafting custom metrics
- Other performance optimization techniques, like resource hints, priority
  hints, lazy-loading, windowing and Preact.
