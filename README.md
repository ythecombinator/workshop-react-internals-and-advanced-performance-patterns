### React: Internals & Advanced Performance Patterns Workshop

Welcome to the `React: Internals & Advanced Performance Patterns` workshop!

This workshop is designed to help you understand the inner workings of React and
master advanced performance optimization techniques.

## üìã Overview

This workshop explores React's internal architecture and mechanisms through
interactive examples and exercises. You'll gain insights into:

- React's reconciliation algorithm
- The Fiber architecture
- Rendering phases and scheduling
- Suspense and concurrent features
- Performance optimization techniques

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Basic knowledge of React

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/ythecombinator/workshop-react-internals-and-advanced-performance-patterns.git
cd workshop-react-internals-and-advanced-performance-patterns
```

2. Install dependencies using Yarn:

```shellscript
yarn
```

3. Start the development server:

```shellscript
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üõ†Ô∏è React DevTools

React DevTools is an essential browser extension for React development and will
be particularly useful for this workshop.

### Installing React DevTools

- [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
- [Edge Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil)

### Using React DevTools in this Workshop

React DevTools will be particularly useful for:

- **Components Tab**: Inspect the component tree, props, state, and hooks
- **Profiler Tab**: Measure rendering performance and identify bottlenecks

## üìö Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized into several sections:

1. **Rendering**: Explore React's reconciliation algorithm and Fiber
   architecture
1. **Scheduling**: Learn about React's scheduling system and priority management
1. **Compilers**: Discover how React code can be optimized at build time
1. **Suspense**: Learn about React's Suspense feature for handling async
   operations
1. **Metrics & Performance**: Tools and techniques for measuring and optimizing
   performance
